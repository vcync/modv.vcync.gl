# Input Links

Input Links allow assigning one parameter to another in modV.

For example, a MIDI controller CC could be assigned to a Module's prop, or Opacity.

## Creating an Input Link

1. Focus the Input Config panel
2. Click on a control in modV, e.g. a Module's Opacity
3. In the Input Config panel, select the type of Input you'd like to link to the control
   * currently an Audio Feature, Tween or MIDI CC
