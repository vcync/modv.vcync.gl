# FPS

Sometimes you want to limit the FPS (frames per second) in order to avoid a performance problem with your computer or because it makes more sense that your visuals run at specific FPS. For this you can double-click with the left mouse on `FPS` in the bottom left corner of modV.

This will open a dialog, where you can specfiy the max FPS you want to use.
